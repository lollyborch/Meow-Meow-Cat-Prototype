DECO7230: Digital Prototyping

Meow Meow Cat is a game that was developed for a digital prototyping subject.

It is a single-player, side-scrolling game that requires players to move in a continuous direction, from left to right, through a series of coloured dots. The player takes on the role of the cat whose aim is to reach a ray of sunshine to take a nap by moving along coloured dots on the screen. Players move Meow Meow along by stepping on the corresponding coloured dot on the floor mat to reach the sunshine.
