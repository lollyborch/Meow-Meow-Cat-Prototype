Meow Meow Cat 
==========

Interactive Prototype 3 (IP3)
----------


To play 'Meow Meow Cat', open the file named 'MMC.swf'.  Upon loading you will view a yellow screen with a timer in the top left corner ('0' on load) and two buttons in the top right corner ('New Game' and 'End').  

To begin play click 'New Game'.  The game can end by either completing the row of dots or by clicking the 'End' button.  You do not need to click 'End' if the game has already finished.



Inputs
----------

The game takes inputs from the four arrow keys.  For IP3, a Makey Makey device connects play dough to the computer.  When the play dough balls are tapped, the inputs are converted to arrow keys inputs.  

To progress the game, tap the corresponding coloured dot to the dot in front of the cat.
